# DesignPatterns

This repository is a showacase of a total of 22 design pattern written in C++.
It was created, mainly to learn how they work in a more practical way, instead of just reading about them.
I've divided them into separate foleders so that it will be easier to find them, as needed. 
This repository is more of a dictionary of all design patterns that I've implemented, that I will come back to in order to apply desired design pattern into a different project. Becasue all of these implementations are made by me & each of them has a unique example of how it works it is easier to get a good grasp on. 

### Compiling
Each of the design pattern is located under it's folder, there is no cmake file nor any makefile. In order to compile one shall navigate to the desired pattern folder, and use g++ to compile it.
`g++ {workspace root}/Patterns/{pattern type}/{pattern name}/main.cpp -o {output filename}`
The above command should do the trick.
